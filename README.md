# Payment-system 2

Payment-system 2 is a testing project where I trying to use the most modern technologies as test-containers, groovy and etc.

## Technology stack

<ul>
  <li>Java 17</li>
  <li>Spring</li>
  <li>Gradle</li>
  <li>Test containers</li>
  <li>Groovy</li>
  <li>Keycloak</li>
</ul>

## Quckstart

Just run docker compose.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Keycloak
For accessing to admin console use admin/admin credentials

Before accessing to REST you have to assignee 'GOD' role to developer user and then use developer/developer during keycloak authorization
