# Payment-system 2

Payment-system 2 is a testing project where I trying to use the most modern technologies as test-containers, groovy and etc.

## Startup

Just run docker compose.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Keycloak
For accessing to admin console use admin/admin credentials

Before accessing to REST you have to assignee 'GOD' role to developer user and then use developer/developer during keycloak authorization
 ```
